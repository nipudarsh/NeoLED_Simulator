# NeoLED Arduino Simulator

A **web-based Arduino LED simulator** that allows you to visually program LEDs using Arduino-style code. This project focuses on **neon LED effects** and is perfect for experimenting with Arduino LED circuits entirely in your browser.

---

## 🔹 Features

- Simulate Arduino **digital pins (D0–D13)** for LEDs
- Add multiple **LEDs** with **pin selection**
- Neon-style **glowing LED circles** with color and brightness control
- Arduino code editor with **setup()** and **loop()**
- Simulate **digitalWrite(), pinMode(), analogWrite(), delay()**
- **Run, Pause, Reset** buttons with live console output
- Demo templates: Blink LED, Knight Rider, Police Siren
- Works fully in the browser (offline capable)

## 🔹 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/nipudarsh/NeoLED_Simulator.git
cd NeoLED_Simulator

Open index.html in your browser.

Select pins for LEDs, choose colors, and write your Arduino code in the editor.

Press Run to see your LEDs light up in neon style!

## 🔹 How to Use

Add LED: Click on the board or use the UI to place an LED.

Select Pin: Assign a digital pin (D0–D13) to the LED.

Pick Color: Choose from neon green, red, blue, or custom.

Adjust Brightness: Use the slider to simulate analogWrite().

Write Code: Use Arduino-style code in the editor.

Run: Start your simulation with the Run button.
